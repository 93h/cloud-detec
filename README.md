# STAT 215A Lab 4: Detecting Clouds in the Arctic
This report uses [MISR](http://www-misr.jpl.nasa.gov/) data to model cloud detection. Signals recorded by MISR are used to predict whether something in an image is or is not a cloud. After initial EDA, we develop several classifiers, asses their fit using a suite of metrics, and finally choose the best model. For this study, we considered logistic regression, random forest, quadratic discriminant analysis and naive bayes.

### Reproducing the Report
While we have not published our dataset, similar data can be obtained from the [NASA Langley Research Center Atmospheric Science Data Center](https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov).
